# Week 6 Lab Report: Bug Catching and Fixing Symptoms

Hello! My name is Nicholas Dai today we will be discussing copying entire directories into the ieng6 account.

## Run command to copy

Here, you can just run the command ```scp -r . cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/markdown-parse``` except with the email address convreted to your own ieng6 account's email address. This copies over the whole markdown-parse directory from your computer to the account.

## Logging in and running tests

Here, you can just run ```ssh cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/markdown-parse``` except with the email address convreted to your own ieng6 account's email address to log in. And then, you can run the tester commands to run tests on the virtual account.

## Combining

Finally, you can just run all the commands in the same line to streamline the whole process.
